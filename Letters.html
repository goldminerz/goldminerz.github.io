<embed>Miscause is a very friendly good friend of mine. He is often there to make sure Iâ€™m ok and that shows a lot thru his big warm heart. He has gone through a rough path but still is putting on happy strong vibes and killing it. He also has such a sweet personality, and even if he is having a bad or grumpy day his sweetness shows threw his apologyâ€™s and just shows how awesome of a person he is. He may or may not see how amazing he is but others are impressed and certainly me. Iâ€™m so glad to have a friend like miscause and overall happy I was lucky enough to meet him. However I sadly happened to encounter his playing saying how he was not going to basically have a good bday so....I couldnâ€™t help myself but put together this idea for him with the help of my amazing bf Gagi :heart: including others we involved In this and helped make your birthday atleast better, We would hate to see you have a bad birthday,  Thanks for being a awesome friend and now birthday boy haha, Your gonna be older then me now making me a baby ;-;. I hope all your dreams and wishes come true Miscause you deserve it, and itâ€™s your day to shine just as bright as you really are my friend ^~^ ~Sincerely Tedzy
