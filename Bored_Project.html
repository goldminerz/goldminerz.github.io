  <td>Miscause is a very friendly good friend of mine. He is often there to make sure I’m ok and that shows a lot thru his big warm heart. He has gone through a rough path but still is putting on happy strong vibes and killing it. He also has such a sweet personality, and even if he is having a bad or grumpy day his sweetness shows threw his apology’s and just shows how awesome of a person he is. He may or may not see how amazing he is but others are impressed and certainly me. I’m so glad to have a friend like miscause and overall happy I was lucky enough to meet him. However I sadly happened to encounter his playing saying how he was not going to basically have a good bday so...
